## Introduction

This dataset contains information related to food orders placed by customers in a New York City food delivery app.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the initial exploration of the NYC Restaurants Food Ordering and Delivery App Dataset, we made the following observations:

- The prefered cuisine type is the American style, but the top 20 customers prefer the Japanese style slightly more. 
- Korean and Vietnamese average cost are the lowest of all, with a median value of 12 dollars.
- Delivery times generally tend to be shorter on weekends.
- There is lack of significant correlation between cost of the order and food preparation and delivery time.

For detailed EDA notebook and visualizations, refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the `NYC Restaurants Data - Food Ordering and Delivery.ipynb` directory.
